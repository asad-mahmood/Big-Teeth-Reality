# Big-Teeth-Reality

## Overview

A new reality show is entering production. A cross between Animal Planet and Fear Factor, it focuses on conflicts between humans and animals with big teeth (crocodiles, tigers, lions, and so on). Contestants never know if they will be chased by the animals or if they will be eating them. The insurance costs will be huge, but the producers think there is a big audience. Producers always think that, but at least they are willing to pay money to find out. The next step is to find people crazy enough to sign the waivers and participate in the show.

## Exercises

1. Create a normalized list of tables for each of the above forms.
2. Create an ERD which shows these tables and fields. You may use PowerPoint or Visio or some other data modeling tool.
3. Define the tables in a DBMS along with the necessary relationships and integrity constraints.
4. Enter sample data to populate the tables to test your design. You do not need to create data entry forms
5. Create queries to answer the following questions:                         
  a. Calculate the average producer and director ratings for a specific event's team members (you pick the event title).

  d. Identify which contestants have not participated in any events.
  e. What is the highest estimated danger level for any event?
